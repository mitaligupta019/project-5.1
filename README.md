# Nand2Tetris Project 5: Memory Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the `Memory` component for the Nand2Tetris course's Project 5. This component is part of the "Computer Architecture" unit, where we build a simple yet functional computer from basic logic gates.

## Overview

The `Memory` chip is a key component of the Hack computer, acting as the main storage unit for both data and instructions. It combines three components:

1. **RAM16K**: A large 16K-word data storage unit.
2. **Screen Memory Map**: A memory-mapped I/O unit representing the screen's pixel data.
3. **Keyboard Memory Map**: A memory-mapped I/O unit representing the keyboard's state.

The `Memory` chip routes inputs and outputs to these subcomponents, allowing for efficient management of system resources.

## Files in This Repository

- **`Memory.hdl`**: The implementation of the `Memory` chip in the Hardware Description Language (HDL).
- **`Memory.tst`**: Test script to verify the correctness of the `Memory` chip.
- **`Memory.cmp`**: Comparison file for the expected results during testing.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

## Functional Specification

The `Memory` chip has the following API:

### Inputs:
- `in[16]`: The 16-bit input data to be stored.
- `load`: A control bit. If `load = 1`, the input data is stored at the selected address.
- `address[15]`: A 15-bit address used to access RAM, Screen, or Keyboard.
- `clock`: The clock signal for synchronization.

### Outputs:
- `out[16]`: The 16-bit data output from the selected memory unit.

### Address Mapping:
- **0 to 16383 (0x0000 to 0x3FFF)**: RAM16K
- **16384 to 24575 (0x4000 to 0x5FFF)**: Screen Memory
- **24576 (0x6000)**: Keyboard Memory

## Implementation

The `Memory` chip multiplexes the input and output signals based on the `address` input. Key decisions include:

- Address decoding to select RAM16K, Screen, or Keyboard.
- Writing to RAM16K or Screen when the `load` signal is active.
- Reading the keyboard state directly for the corresponding address.

### Design Considerations:
- Efficient handling of clock synchronization for write operations.
- Logical routing for address-based access.

## Testing

To test the `Memory.hdl` file:

1. Load the project files into the Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator.
2. Open the `Memory.tst` test script.
3. Run the script and compare the results with `Memory.cmp`.

The simulation should confirm that the `Memory` chip correctly handles all specified input-output behaviors.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nand2tetris-memory.git
   cd nand2tetris-memory
   ```
2. Open `Memory.hdl` in the Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator.
3. Test the implementation using the provided test script.
